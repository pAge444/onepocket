# Onepocket Node.js skills with a small coding test
## First task: Basic Node.js Server
Create a simple Node.js server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello, World!" for all incoming HTTP requests. You can use any library or framework of your choice.

Server is created using express framework. (file app.js)

To start server please run command : "npm run start"

Route: http://localhost:3000/

## Second task: Data Manipulation
Write a function in Node.js that takes an array of integers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers.

Code implementation of function done in file sumFunction.js

Function calculate the sum of pre-defined array = [45,34,13,67]

Route: http://localhost:3000/sum
## Third task: Asynchronous File Handling
Create a Node.js script that reads a text file named "data.txt" and counts the number of words in it. The script should print the total word count to the console.

File handling is done by using fs module.

Code implementation of function done in file countWordInTextFile.js

Route: http://localhost:3000/countWord
